# Eco_Voyage_Service_Design
1. Project Overview 🌍
Problem Addressed: Urban travelers face difficulties with disorganized tours and inadequate transportation options, preventing them from fully enjoying their cultural experiences. 🏙️

Solution: Eco-Voyage offers a seamless travel experience, integrating sustainable travel options like carbon rewards and enhanced navigation through AR/VR virtual tours. 🚴‍♂️🌱 The platform promotes both user-friendliness and sustainability.

2. Design Thinking Process 💡
Empathy ❤️:

The process began with creating a stakeholder map, merging individual inputs to identify key stakeholders. 👥 Interviews were conducted, leading to the development of personas to better understand the needs of travelers.

Persona Creation: After shortlisting major personas, you explored their needs through empathy mapping, focusing on user roles, touchpoints, needs, and moods. 😊🗺️

Define 📝:

The problem statement was derived from your research and clearly articulated: “Lisa Carter struggles with navigating the city due to disorganized tours and inadequate transportation options, making it difficult to fully enjoy her cultural experiences.” 🎯

Ideate 💭:

Through brainstorming and Crazy 8s, you explored various ideas such as personalized tours and AR/VR integration. Your idea of using carbon cash rewards aligned with both sustainability and user experience. ♻️💡

Prototype 🖥️:

After ideating, you transitioned to wireframing and prototyping using Figma, creating visual mockups and refining your designs through feedback. 🔧📐

Prototypes were built with a focus on usability, and you leveraged tools like the Iconify plugin to enhance the visual elements. 🎨

3. Tools & Resources 🛠️
Figma: Used extensively for wireframing, mockups, and prototypes. 🎨

AI Tools: Employed AI-powered logo design (via Design.com) and used ChatGPT for interview transcription. 🤖📝

Learning Resources: Self-learned Figma through tutorials and blog articles, further improving your UI design skills. 📚👨‍💻

4. Key Takeaways 🎓
Collaboration: Working in a team helped you understand the power of combining diverse ideas to create impactful solutions. 🤝

Prototyping: You learned the iterative nature of prototyping—testing, gathering feedback, and refining your design. 🔄

Sustainability Focus: Eco-Voyage integrates sustainability through features like carbon cash rewards, showcasing your commitment to environmental impact. 🌍💚

5. Final Deliverables 🏁
Prototypes: Share the link to your Figma prototype, allowing viewers to directly explore your design work. 🔗

Story and Framework: The visual story through your maps, personas, and journey maps effectively conveys the process behind Eco-Voyage. 📊📈
